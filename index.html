      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>
        We are a non-profit organisation that aims to pressure the governments of the world to ban fuel powered cars on the road.
        We do this by pressuring governments into putting plans into place and accelerating the plans already in place to switch to
        fully electric vehicles on the road.
      </p>
      <h2>Why we do it</h2>
      <p>
        The Amount of cars on the road has grown a huge amount in the last few years. This can be attributed to the general growth in
        population. The planet has already been damaged enough. We simply can not let it be damaged more and more as the years go on.
